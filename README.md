# About the project
This is a personal pet project Iâ€™ve been developing to explore Android app architecture and improve my skills.

The application is intended to help system administrators manage a local inventory of network equipment.
It serves as a lightweight, user-friendly alternative to NetBox, built specifically for Android with an offline-first approach.
